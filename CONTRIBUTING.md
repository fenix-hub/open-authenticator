Open Authenticator is a free and open source project, born with the intention of sharing what I have learned studying different technologies and protocols, such as JWT, OAuth2, 2fa, HOTP.  
The goal is to create a project accessible to all, transparent, usable to manage two-factor security privately and offline. Any contribution in line with this philosophy will be welcome.
